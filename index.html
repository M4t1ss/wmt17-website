    </p>

    <h3>REGISTRATION</h3>
    Registration will be handled by <a href="http://emnlp2017.net/">EMNLP 2017</a>.

    <h3>NEWS TRANSLATION TASK</h3>
    <p>
      The first shared task which will examine translation between the
      following language pairs:
      <ul>
	      <li> English-Chinese and Chinese-English <font color=red><b>NEW</b></font> </li>
        <li> English-Czech and Czech-English</li>
        <li> English-Finnish and Finnish-English </li>
        <li> English-German and German-English</li>
	      <li> English-Latvian and Latvian-English <font color=red><b>NEW</b></font></li>
	      <li> English-Russian and Russian-English </li>
	      <li> English-Turkish and Turkish-English </li>
      </ul>
      The text for all the test sets will be drawn from news articles.
      Participants may submit translations for any or all of the language
      directions. In addition to the common test sets the conference organizers
      will provide optional training resources.
    </p>

    <p>
      All participants who submit entries will have their translations
      evaluated. We will evaluate translation performance by human judgment. To
      facilitate the human evaluation we will require participants in the
      shared tasks to manually judge some of the submitted translations. For each team,
      this will amount
      to ranking 300 sets of 5 translations, per language pair submitted.
    </p>

<h3>BIOMEDICAL TRANSLATION TASK</h3> 

<p>In this second edition of this task, we will evaluate systems for the translation of biomedical documents for the following languages pairs:<p>

<ul>
<li> English-Czech and Czech-English <font color=red><b>NEW</b></font></li>
<li> English-French and French-English </li>
<li> English-German and German-English <font color=red><b>NEW</b></font></li>
<li> English-Hungarian and Hungarian-English <font color=red><b>NEW</b></font></li>
<li> English-Polish and Polish-English <font color=red><b>NEW</b></font></li>
<li> English-Portuguese and Portuguese-English </li>
<li> English-Romanian and Romanian-English <font color=red><b>NEW</b></font></li>
<li> English-Spanish and Spanish-English </li>
<li> English-Swedish and Swedish-English <font color=red><b>NEW</b></font></li>
</ul>

<p>Parallel corpora will be available for all language pairs but also monoligual corpora for some languages. 
Evaluation will be carried out both automatically and manually.</p>



	<h3>AUTOMATIC POST-EDITING TASK</h3>
<p>This shared task will examine automatic methods for correcting errors produced by machine translation (MT) systems.  Automatic Post-editing (APE) aims at improving MT output in black box scenarios, in which the MT system is used "as is" and cannot be modified.
From the application point of view APE components would make it possible to:</p>
<ul>
<li> Cope with systematic errors of an MT system whose decoding process is not accessible </li>
<li> Provide professional translators with improved MT output quality to reduce (human) post-editing effort </li>
</ul>

<p>In this third edition of the task, the evaluation will focus on English-German (IT domain) and German-English (Medical domain)</p>


    <h3>METRICS TASK</h3>
<p>The metrics task (also called evaluation task) will assess automatic evaluation metrics' ability to:
</p>

<ul>
<li> Evaluate systems on their overall performance on the test set </li>
<li> Evaluate systems on a sentence by sentence level </li>
</ul>

<p>
Participants in the shared evaluation task will use their automatic evaluation metrics to score the output from the translation task and the NMT training task.  In addition to MT outputs from the other two tasks, the participants will be provided with reference translations.   We will measure the correlation of automatic evaluation metrics with the human judgments.  
</p>

<!--
    <h3>QUALITY ESTIMATION TASK</h3>

<p> Quality estimation systems aim at producing an estimate on the quality of a given translation at system run-time, without access to a reference translation. This topic is particularly relevant from a user perspective. Among other applications, it can (i) help decide whether a given translation is good enough for publishing as is; (ii) filter out sentences that are not good enough for post-editing; (iii) select the best translation among options from multiple MT and/or translation memory systems; (iv) inform readers of the target language of whether or not they can rely on a translation; and (v) spot parts (words or phrases) of a translation that are potentially incorrect.</p>

    <p>Research on this topic has been showing promising results in the last couple of years. Building on the last three years' experience, the Quality-Estimation track of the WMT15 workshop and shared-task will focus on English, Spanish and German as languages and provide new training and test sets, along with evaluation metrics and baseline systems for variants of the task at three different levels of prediction: word, sentence, and document.

-->
    <h3>NEURAL MT TRAINING TASK (NMT TRAINING TASK)</h3>

This task will assess your team's ability to <b>train a fixed neural MT model</b> given fixed data.

<p>
Participants in the NMT training task will be given complete a Neural Monkey configuration file which describes the neural model. Training and validation data with fixed pre-processing scheme will be also given (English-to-Czech and Czech-to-English translation).
</p>
<p>
The participants will be expected to submit the variables file, i.e. the trained neural network, for one or both of the translation directions. We will use the variables and a fixed revision of Neural Monkey to translate official WMT17 test set. The outputs of the various configurations of the system will be scored using the standard manual evaluation procedure.
</p>

<h3>BANDIT LEARNING TASK</h3>
<p>Bandit Learning for MT is a framework to train and improve MT systems by learning from weak or partial feedback: Instead of a gold-standard human-generated translation, the learner only receives feedback to a single proposed translation (this is why it is called partial), in form of a translation quality judgement (which can be as weak as a binary acceptance/rejection decision).
</p>
<!--<p> Amazon and University of Heidelberg organize this Shared Task with a goal to encourage researchers to investigate algorithms for learning from weak user feedback instead of from human references or post-edits that require skilled translators. We are interested in finding systems that learn efficiently and effectively from this type of feedback, i.e. they learn fast and achieve high translation quality. Developing such algorithms is interesting for interactive machine learning and for human feedback in NLP in general.
</p>-->
<p> In this task, the user feedback will be simulated by a service hosted on Amazon Web Services (AWS), where participants can submit translations and receive feedback and use this feedback for training an MT model (German-to-English, e-commerce). Reference translations will not be revealed at any point, also evaluations are done via the service. The goal of this task is to find systems that learn efficiently and effectively from this type of feedback, i.e. they learn fast and achieve high translation quality without references.
</p>

<h3>CROSS-LINGUAL PRONOUN PREDICTION TASK</h3>
<p>Pronoun translation poses a problem for current state-of-the-art SMT systems as pronoun systems do not map well across languages, e.g., due to differences in gender, number, case, formality, or humanness, and to differences in where pronouns may be used. Translation divergences typically lead to mistakes in SMT, as when translating the English "it" into French ("il", "elle", or "cela"?) or into German ("er", "sie", or "es"?). One way to model pronoun translation is to treat it as a cross-lingual pronoun prediction task.</p>

    <p>We propose such a task, which asks participants to predict a target-language pronoun given a source-language pronoun in the context of a sentence. We further provide a lemmatised target-language human-authored translation of the source sentence, and automatic word alignments between the source sentence words and the target-language lemmata. In the translation, the words aligned to a subset of the source-language third-person pronouns are substituted by placeholders. The aim of the task is to predict, for each placeholder, the word that should replace it from a small, closed set of classes, using any type of information that can be extracted from the documents.</p>

    <p>The cross-lingual pronoun prediction task will be similar to the task of the same name at DiscoMT 2015:</p>

	<a href="http://www.idiap.ch/workshop/DiscoMT/shared-task">http://www.idiap.ch/workshop/DiscoMT/shared-task</a>

    <p>Participants are invited to submit systems for the English-French and English-German language pairs, for both directions.</p>

<h3>BILINGUAL DOCUMENT ALIGNMENT TASK</h3>
Details TBC

<h3>MULTIMODAL TRANSLATION TASK</h3>

This is a new task where participants are requested to generate a description for an image in a target language, given the image itself and one or more descriptions in a different (source) language. 

    <h3>PAPER SUBMISSION INFORMATION</h3>

    <p>
      Submissions will consist of regular full papers of 6-10 pages, plus
      additional pages for references, formatted following the 
      <a href="http://acl2016.org">ACL 2016
      guidelines</a>. In addition, shared task participants will be invited to
      submit short papers (suggested length: 4-6 pages, plus references) describing their systems or their
      evaluation metrics. Both submission and review processes will be handled
      <a href="https://www.softconf.com/acl2016/WMT16/">electronically</a>.
      Note that regular papers must be anonymized, while system descriptions 
      do not need to be.
    </p>

    <p>
      We encourage individuals who are submitting research papers to evaluate
      their approaches using the training resources provided by this conference
      and past workshops, so that their experiments can be repeated by others
      using these publicly available corpora.
