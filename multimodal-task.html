      <script src="menu.js"></script>
    </center>

<p>This is shared task is aimed at the generation of image descriptions in a target language. The task can be addressed from two different perspectives:
<ul>
<li>as a <b><a href="#task1">translation task</a></b>, which will take a source language description and translate it into the target language, where this process can be supported by information from the image (multimodal translation), and </li>
<li>as a <b><a href="#task2">description generation task</a></b>,
  which will take an image and generate a description for it in the
  target language, with <b>no</b> additional source language
  information (multilingual image description generation). </li>
</ul>

<!--We welcome participants focusing on either or both of these task variants. They differ mainly in the training data and in the way the target language descriptions are evaluated: against one translation of the corresponding source description (translation variant) or against one or more descriptions of the same image in the target language, created independently from the corresponding source description (image description variant).
-->
This shared task has the following main <b>goals</b>:

<ul>
<li>To push existing work on the integration of computer vision and language processing. </li>   
<li>To push existing work on multimodal language processing towards multilingual multimodal language processing.</li>
<li>To investigate the effectiveness of information from images in machine translation. </li>
<li>To investigate image description generation in a multilingual setting.</li>
</ul>

<p>We welcome participants focusing on either or both of these task
variants.</p>

<p>This task consists in translating English sentences that describe an image into German and/or French, given the English sentence itself and the image that it describes (or features from this image, if participants chose to). For this task, the Flickr30K Entities dataset was extended in the following way: for each image, one of the English descriptions was selected and manually translated into German and French by professional translators. <!--; the translator was not given access to the image -->
</p>

<p>As <i><font color="green">training</font></i> and <i><font color="green">development</font></i> data, we provide 29,000, and 1,014 triples respectively, each containing an English source sentence, its German and French human translations and corresponding image. We also provide the 2016 test set, which people can use for validation/evaluation. The English-German datasets are the same as those in 2016, but we note that human translations in the 2016 validation and test datasets have been post-edited (by humans) using the images to make sure the target descriptions are faithful to these images. There were cases where in the 2016 the source text was ambiguous and the image was used to solve the ambiguities. The French translations were added in 2017.  

<p>As <i><font color="green">test data</font></i>, we provide a new set of 1,000 tuples containing an English description and its corresponding image.  Gold labels will be translations in German or French. 

<p><i><font color="green">Evaluation</font></i> will be performed against the German or French human translations of  the test set using standard MT evaluation metrics, with METEOR as the primary metric (lowercased text, with punctuation, tokenised). We recommend <a href="https://github.com/moses-smt/mosesdecoder/blob/master/scripts/tokenizer/normalize-punctuation.perl">normalising punctuation</a> and <a href="https://github.com/moses-smt/mosesdecoder/blob/master/scripts/tokenizer/tokenizer.perl">tokenising</a> the system submissions using these scripts. They will be used for the reference translations too. Each language will be evaluated independently.
<!--(Here are some <a href="http://www.quest.dcs.shef.ac.uk/wmt16_files_mmt/wmt16mmt_notes_Task1">additional notes</a> on how we did the evaluation.) We may also include manual evaluation.
<!--<p><b><font color="red">New</font></b>: The METEOR command is the following (e.g. for en-de, using <a href="https://github.com/jhclark/multeval">multeval implementation</a>): 
<p>
<font face="Courier New" size="2">
./multeval.sh eval --refs wmt2016/de_test/reference.ref --hyps-baseline baseline_model/de/generated --hyps-sys1 my_great_model/de_generated --meteor.language de
</font>

<p><font color="magenta">For those interested in translating in the inverse direction, i.e., German into English, we can release a test set for that direction. The training and development sets will remain the same, their translation direction can simply be flipped. </font>
-->

<p>The <i><font color="green">baselines</font></i> for this task will be 
<!--both a Moses phrase-based statistical machine translation system trained using only the textual training data provided, following the pipeline described <a href="http://www.statmt.org/moses/?n=moses.baseline">here</a>, and -->

<p>This task consists in generating a German sentence that describes
an image, given <b>only</b> the image for <b>unseen data</b>. For this task, the Flickr30K dataset was extended in the following way: for each image, five German descriptions were crowdsourced independently from their English versions, and independently from each other. 
Any English-German pair of descriptions for a given image could be considered a comparable translation pair.  We will provide the images and associated descriptions for training, while smaller portions will be used for development and test.

<!-- SUBMISSION INFO -->

<h3>Submission Requirements</h3>

<p>You are encouraged to submit a short report (4 to 6 pages) to WMT
describing your method(s). You are not required to
submit a paper if you do not want to. In that case, we ask you
to provide a summary and/or an appropriate reference describing your method(s) that we can cite
in the WMT overview paper.</p>

Each participating team can submit at most 2 systems for each of the task variants (so up to 4 submissions). These should be sent
via email to Lucia Specia <a href="mailto:lspecia@gmail.com" target="_blank">lspecia@gmail.com</a>. Please use the following pattern to name your files:
<p>
<code>INSTITUTION-NAME</code>_<code>TASK-NAME</code>_<code>METHOD-NAME</code>_<code>TYPE</code>, where:
<p> <code>INSTITUTION-NAME</code> is an acronym/short name for your institution, e.g. SHEF
<p><code>TASK-NAME</code> is one of the following: 1 (translation), 2 (description), 3 (both).
<p><code>METHOD-NAME</code> is an identifier for your method in case you have multiple methods for the same task, e.g. 2_NeuralTranslation, 2_Moses
<p><code>TYPE</code> is either C or U, where C indicates "constrained", i.e. using only the resources provided by the task organisers, and U indicates "unconstrained".
<p> For instance, a constrained submission from team SHEF for task 2 using method "Moses" could be named SHEF_2_Moses_C.

<h3>Submission Format</h3>

<p> The output of your system <b>a given task</b> should produce a target language description for each image formatted in the following way: </p>
<pre>&lt;METHOD NAME&gt; &lt;IMAGE ID&gt; &lt;DESCRIPTION&gt; &lt;TASK&gt; &lt;TYPE&gt;<br><br></pre>
Where:
<ul>
<li><code>METHOD NAME</code> is the name of your method.</li>
<li><code>IMAGE ID</code> is the identifier of the test image.</li>
<li><code>DESCRIPTION</code> is the output generated by your system (either a translation or an independently generated description). </li>
<li><code>TASK</code> is one of the following flags: 1 (for translation task), 2 (for image description task), 3 (for both). The choice here will indicate how your descriptions will be evaluated. Option 3 means they will be evaluated both as a translation task and as an image description task.</li>
<li><code>TYPE</code> is either C or U, where C indicates "constrained", i.e. using only the resources provided by the task organisers, and U indicates "unconstrained".</li>
</ul>
Each field should be delimited by a single tab character.
